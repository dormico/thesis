\chapter{Summary}\label{Ch7}

Here I will summarize my impressions while working on this project.

\section{Azure Serverless}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall I had a pleasant experience with Microsoft Azure. One doesn't have to know everything to start. Azure is most of the time well documented. I worked with services that got published recently e.g.\ Communication Services for email sending or Partial Document Update for Cosmos DB. Most of the time I could use these by only reading the official documentation. On the rare occasion I needed a more specific solution, there were developers who already faced the same issue and came to some solution so I could figure out the missing parts by myself. The usage of the software was for the most part straightforward and there is a fairly reliable community.

One aspect what developers often complain of is the difficulty of debugging the server side. Granted, the error messages were some of the time non-existent. Occasionally waiting a little bit longer solved the problem and the function worked afterwards. When it did not help, testing the service locally and following the small leads I got did and the issues turned out to be discoverable and solvable. Later on when I collected a bit of experience I could guess what caused the bug. Note that mine was only a small example and in a huge system it's probably not that easy and not a good idea to rely on assumptions.

\section{Microservices}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another thing I became a big fan of are microservices. At first it took some time to figure out their usage but then it turned out to be a handy tool. I did not get lost in the code base, which is a big plus especially in case of a big project. Testing and modifying the functions was straightforward, it wasn't a concern from which part of the API an error comes, because there were distinct collections of files that were not dependent on each other.
An additional benefit of this is that each microservice can have its own configuration, which reduces the number of installed packages to only those, which are used by that service's functions.

The price for this convenience is that it takes extra effort. Nonetheless, in my experience they save a lot more time than it takes to set up each of them, what went reasonably fast with Azure.
